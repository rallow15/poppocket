# Model
A slime blob with 4 LODs.

# Shader
Shaders for the built-in pipeline and URP are provided. *No support for HDRP.*
- Blends smoothly into the environmental lighting.
- Or use the 'Fake Environment' option to completely decouple from the scene.

> 💡The shader is constructed using Amplify Shader Editor.
>
> ❗Please note that the built-in pipeline version is missing a required node, so we had to copy and modify the original "Indirect Specular Lighting" node. We can't share the source file because it's essentially a copy of ASE's source code. **THIS WILL NOT AFFECT THE SHADER'S FUNCTIONALITY**. It only matters if you want to modify the shader. The URP version works fine.
